LibZontreck
=======


This is a library mod for all of zontreck's mods. Also known as Aria.

The library can be used freely by other modders, but with the understanding that I may change something with little to no notice. 

If the mod becomes widely used, I will begin using deprecation notices.


Compatibility
=====

1) LuckPerms
   
   LuckPerms is highly outdated for 1.18.2, but i have compiled a working version for forge. You can obtain it manually from https://github.com/zontreck/LuckPerms. Just check the release page for the latest update.  There should not be any updates however, as the entire goal here is to only make it compatible with the latest forge version.

2) TBA

   There will be at least one other mod that is compatible. This is to be announced at a later time.
